# Deep-neural-network-using-tensorflow
deep neural network using tensorflow for binary classification of data

## Getting Started 
Everything you need to start running up the project from build to end.

### Prerequisite
~~~
Python 3.5, Numpy, Sklearn, Pandas & Matplotlib.
~~~

### How it works (Simple Neural Network) :-
~~~
 Step 1 :- Importing & reading the Dataset.
 
 Step 2 :- Extracting Feature & Target Variable..
 
 Step 3 :- Fiting Logistic Regression On data.
 
 Step 4 :- Creating a Deep Neural Net from Scratch.
 
 Step 5 :- Creating & Training the Model.
 
 Step 6 :- Using Our Model For Prediction
 
 Step 7 :- Visualizaing The Output using decision Boundry
